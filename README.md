# rscripts
R scripts with templates and examples of analyses using knitr with Rmarkdown or LaTeX

This is for use with the R function getRs (included in this repository) for auto-populating an RStudio script editor window with a script stored here.  Windows users must install wget in order to access github because it uses https instead of http.  Installation instructions are at <http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/RConfiguration>.

The special file contents.md lists all the available files and short descriptions for them.  It should be edited whenever new scripts are added.

The scripts included here use a template that makes the result part of a reproducible research process by documenting the versions of R and attached packages at the end of the report.
