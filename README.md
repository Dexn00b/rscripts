# rscripts
R scripts with templates and examples of analyses using knitr with Rmarkdown or LaTeX

This is for use with the R function getRs (included in this repository) for auto-populating an RStudio script editor window with a script stored here.

The special file contents.md lists all the available files and short descriptions for them.  It should be edited whenever new scripts are added.
